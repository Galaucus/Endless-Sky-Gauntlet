I. Goals
-Provide repeatable end-game content.
	-This content will largely take the form of a gauntlet. Missions are structured around the player being given a handful of keys to enter the nebula. 

-Fully kitting out a ship should require a bit of a grind

-The grind should actually be fun, not frustrating; focus on skill instead of RNG
	-Getting loot out is best done with a freighter, but heavy freighters are too vulnerable. This rewards nimble/up-gunned freighters, or cargo-modified warships.

	-The player will need a transport or marine-oriented warship in order to capture
	vessels. Exit should only be possible after completing mission objectives or aborting in order to prevent farms.
	
	-Give ships a large disable window, no random boarding failure. Getting loot or spending crew boarding a ship is a decision point, not a lucky break.
