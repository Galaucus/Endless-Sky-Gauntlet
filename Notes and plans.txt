I. Goals
-Provide repeatable end-game content.
	-This content will largely take the form of a gauntlet. Missions are structured around the player being given a handful of keys to enter the nebula. 

-Fully kitting out a ship should require a bit of a grind

-The grind should actually be fun, not frustrating; focus on skill instead of RNG
	-Getting loot out is best done with a freighter, but heavy freighters are too vulnerable. This rewards nimble/up-gunned freighters, or cargo-modified warships.

	-The player will need a transport or marine-oriented warship in order to capture
	vessels. Exit should only be possible after completing mission objectives or aborting in order to prevent farms.
	
	-Give ships a large disable window, no random boarding failure. Getting loot or spending crew boarding a ship is a decision point, not a lucky break.

III. Outfits

IV. Lore
	
	Hyper-isolationist species living in a green-tinged nebula. Fully hostile to the player.
	Refugee/Exile/Rebel faction sides with the player after making contact with captives from the first expedition into the wormhole. Rebels assign the player targets and provide the keystones needed to get in/out of the nebula. 
	
	Consider making the isolationist former Pug thralls. They played along for some time, but eventually decided enough was enough. Rather than follow the wormhole to their new assignment they stayed put, purposefully severing the only wormhole leading out.
		-The Pug abandoned them and created the Wanderers instead?
		-They're a faction of Wanderers from a handful of molt-cycles ago who decided to stay in their homes rather than move on?
		-They're a military reserve being kept bottled by the Pug. Though the Pug seem more than capable of fighting themselves, so... Probably not this.
		-They purposefully rebelled against the Pug and were locked away as punishment?
	
	At any rate, the governing regime is so thoroughly isolationist that they hunt down and kill anyone with the knowledge to make a quantum key that allows passage through the wormhole. This knowledge is passed down from refugee to refugee, with each generation crafting keys, escaping, then destroying them so that they can't be followed. As such, the refugee faction is only willing to *lend* keys to the player, requiring their return at the end of the mission.
	

V. Missions

	Get to the center, kill the boss
	-Fairly straightforward. Player will be bottlenecked by lack of hyperlinks and wormhole-based transit, possibly defense stations guarding each wormhole. This requires them to actually fight their way to the boss.
	
	Refugee rescue
	-Board OR kill the prison transport
	-Big rep gain for boarding it and escaping
	-Refugee faction will accept the death of their comrades as better than imprisonment, but will act glum.
	
	Smuggling goods/people
	-Move goods/VIPs from one refugee faction stronghold to another, OR to a regime-controlled planet
	-You'll be under attack the entire way. This isn't so much smuggling as transport through hostile territory. 
	
	Evacuation
	-Fight your way to a planet
	-Defeat its defense fleet
	-Land, fill all your bunks with refugees
	-Escape the nebula
